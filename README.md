# Android-Slow-Motion-Camera2
Android camera utilizing the new Android Camera2 API.

This is a very simple high speed/slow motion recorder for Android API 21 and up. It uses the new camera2 api.

Please keep in mind that this program is not compilable in this state. The reason being that I am not allowed to open source the entire program. Therefore only crucial parts are added and should instead be read and implemented in your own program as needed.
Furthermore there might be missing ressources such as images for graphical buttons. Please create ones yourself or just convert it to conventional buttons.

Since it is very early in development, there might still be ways to optimize the code. For now it works, and feel free to implement and modify the code as wanted.
